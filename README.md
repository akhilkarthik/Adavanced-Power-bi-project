## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI analysis focused on visualizing and analyzing Spotify data. The analysis incorporates various elements, including HTML cover art, DENEB visuals, and a Glassmorphism background.

## Components

### Power BI Building

Utilized Power BI's intuitive interface for data importing, cleaning, and transformation. Developed interactive visualizations and dashboards to provide insights into Spotify data.

### HTML Cover Art

Integrated HTML to dynamically display cover art in the Power BI report. Cover art URLs were fetched from the Spotify API, and HTML code was embedded within Power BI.
